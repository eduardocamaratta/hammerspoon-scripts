# Hammerspoon Scripts

My personal Hammerspoon scripts


## Instructions

- Install Hammerspoon (Duh!)
- Configure it to launch at login and give it accessibility access
- Copy the script to ~/.hammerspoon (final path: ~/.hammerspoon/init.lua)
- Reload the configuration in Hammerspoon


## Features

The current script contains shortcuts to move a window to the next display (ctrl + alt + cmd + n), maximize (ctrl + alt + cmd + up), and split horizontally - to the left (ctrl + alt + cmd + left) and to the right (ctrl + alt + cmd + right).
